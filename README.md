# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

## Live Demo

Explore the live application at: [Sorting Algorithms Visualization](https://algorithm-visualizer-liard.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This project is a web application developed using React that visually demonstrates two sorting algorithms: **Merge Sort** and **Bubble Sort**. The application allows users to adjust the number of elements and the speed of sorting, providing an interactive learning experience for understanding sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Users can visualize the sorting process of Merge Sort and Bubble Sort.
- **Element Control**: A slider to change the number of elements in the dataset for sorting.
- **Speed Adjustment**: A slider to control the speed of the sorting animation, allowing for both fast and slow visualizations.
- **Randomized Dataset**: A button to generate a new array of randomized elements for sorting.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Elements under comparison are highlighted during the sorting process, improving understanding of the algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the state.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and application logic.
